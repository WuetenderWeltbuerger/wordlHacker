# wordlHacker
A short Program to choose the optimal responses to the game Wordl
the program includes a reference to the words.py file
there is a function within the main program that checks each word
in the file for length so that only the 5 letter words are included
you can help by expanding the words list in words.py

the main program is still under construction as of dec 6th
